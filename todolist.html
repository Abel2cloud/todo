Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, 
give it your own personal style.

In this lab, you will practice the different styles that can be applied to links when they are hovered
 over, focused, clicked, and visited.

Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should have one unordered list with the class todo-list.

Inside the unordered list, you should have four list items.

Inside each list item, there should be:

An input element with the type checkbox and id set to a unique value.
A label element with the for attribute set to the corresponding input element's id.
An unordered list with the class sub-item.
A list item with an anchor element in it. The anchor should have the class sub-item-link,
 a valid href value, and a target value that makes the link open in a new tab.
Your anchor elements shouldn't have any default text decoration.

You should set the text color of the links to a color of your choice.

When your links are visited, the color should change to another color of your choice.

When your links are hovered over, the color should change to another color of your choice.

When your links are focused, there should be a colored outline around the link.

When your links are clicked, the color should change to another color of your choice.
